### How to create a new issue (for those who have never used GitHub)

We welcome bug reports, feature requests, and questions. If you have never used GitHub before, follow these simple steps to create a clear, helpful issue so we can respond quickly.

1. Create or sign in to a GitHub account
   - Go to https://github.com.
   - If you already have an account, click "Sign in" and enter your username and password.
   - If you don't have an account, click "Sign up" and follow the steps to create one.

2. Open the Issues page for this project
   - Navigate to this repository (the page you're on).
   - Click the "Issues" tab near the top of the page.
   - If you do not see an "Issues" tab, it may be disabled—see the note near the end of this section.

3. Start a new issue
   - Click the green "New issue" button on the Issues page.

4. Choose a template (if offered)
   - If the project provides templates, pick the one that best matches your report (e.g., Bug report, Feature request).
   - Templates already include suggested fields to fill in—just follow them.

5. Write a good title
   - Keep it short and specific. Example: "App crashes when tapping 'Save' after entering a long note".

6. Fill in the issue body with these helpful sections
   - Use plain English and be concise. Use numbered steps where possible.

   Example layout you can copy and fill in:

   - Steps to reproduce:
     1. Open the app.
     2. Tap "Add prayer".
     3. Type a very long note and tap "Save".
   - Expected result:
     - The prayer is saved and the app returns to the list view.
   - Actual result:
     - The app freezes and then crashes.
   - App version and device:
     - App version: v1.2.3
     - Device: iPhone 12, iOS 16.4 (or: Google Pixel 4, Android 12)
   - Any error messages or logs:
     - Paste the exact error message you saw, or attach a screenshot.
   - Screenshots / screen recordings:
     - Drag and drop images or press the image icon in the editor to attach. Screenshots help a lot.
   - Additional information:
     - Anything else you think is relevant (network conditions, whether you tried restarting the app, etc.)

7. Attach files and logs
   - Images: drag-and-drop or paste screenshots into the issue description.
   - Logs: paste text directly (wrap it in triple backticks ```like this```), or attach a plain .txt file.
   - Do NOT post passwords, API keys, or other private data. If logs contain sensitive information, remove or redact it before attaching.

8. Labels and assignees
   - If you don't see label/assignee options, that's normal — only project collaborators can set those. Leave that to us; just submit the issue.

9. Preview and submit
   - Use the "Preview" tab to check formatting.
   - Click "Submit new issue" when you're ready.

10. After you submit
    - You will receive email notifications (if enabled) about updates.
    - Maintainers may ask for more details. Please reply in the issue with additional information when requested.
    - If you find a workaround or fix, add a comment so others can benefit.

11. How to follow up
    - To add more information later, open the issue and add a new comment.
    - To mention someone in an issue, type @ followed by their GitHub username (for example: @username). This notifies them.

12. If you can't create an issue
    - If the "Issues" tab is missing or disabled, the project may not accept issues via GitHub. Check the repository's README for contact details or project website. If no contact is listed, look for a "Discussions" tab or other linked support channels.

13. Helpful tips
    - One bug = one issue. If you have several unrelated problems, create separate issues.
    - Be patient and polite. Maintainers are often volunteers.
    - Use plain language and include facts: exact steps, exact text of error messages, device type, and app version.
